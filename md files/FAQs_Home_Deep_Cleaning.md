# FAQs Home Deep Cleaning

### 1. What does a full house deep cleaning service include?
Our full house deep cleaning service covers every area of your home, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, balcony, and living spaces. We handle dusting, mopping, vacuuming, sanitising, and polishing to give you a hygienic environment. You can also opt for extras like sofa shampooing, wall cleaning, or appliance deep cleaning. The service is customised based on your home’s size and current condition.

### 2. How much does deep cleaning service cost?
The cost of deep cleaning varies based on home size (like 1BHK, 2BHK, or 3BHK), the level of dirt or clutter, and any add-on services such as wall stain removal or post-renovation cleanup. We offer upfront, transparent pricing with no hidden fees.

### 3. Are your cleaners trained professionals and background-verified?
Yes, all our cleaning professionals are background verified, skilled, and trained in advanced deep cleaning methods. They follow safety protocols and are experienced in handling everything from basic cleaning to post-painting cleanup and move-in readiness.

### 4. Do I need to be home during the cleaning?
It’s not mandatory to stay home during the cleaning, but we recommend being present during the initial walkthrough to finalise your requirements. After that, you are free to go about your day. Many clients prefer leaving us the key and returning to a sparkling home.

### 5. How is pricing calculated for house deep cleaning services?

### 14. Can you clean appliances and furniture?
We clean refrigerators, ovens, chimneys, and even furniture like sofas, mattresses, and chairs. Special shampoos and tools are used for fabric and upholstery cleaning to ensure a fresh, spotless finish.

### 15. Can you help with organising and decluttering?
Our cleaners can assist with basic organizing while cleaning, such as arranging items neatly or clearing clutter. For major decluttering or pre-paint prep, we can refer to professional organizing experts.
