# FAQs Babysitter Nanny

### 1. What is the difference between a babysitter and a nanny?

A babysitter is usually hired for short-term help like watching your child for a few hours or during special occasions. A nanny, on the other hand, offers full-time or long-term support. Nannies handle daily routines, help with learning activities, and provide emotional care, becoming a consistent part of your child’s life.

### 2. Are babysitters and nannies background verified?
Yes, your child’s safety is our top priority. All EzyHelpers babysitter services and nannies undergo thorough background checks, police verification, and childcare training, ensuring secure and professional care.

### 3. What are the different types of childcare service options you offer?
 We offer flexible childcare solutions tailored to your needs:

Live-in babysitters: 24/7 care and supervision.
