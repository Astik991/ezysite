3\. Do I need to pay upfront, or can I pay after the emergency service is completed?

You can pay after the service is completed. We accept multiple payment methods, including cash, UPI, and card. The total charge is confirmed before the service begins, and payment is only required once you're satisfied with the help provided.

4\. Can I request a female helper for emergency babysitting or elderly care?

Yes, you can request a female helper. We understand that families may prefer female support for services like babysitting or elder care. Just let us know your preference while booking. We try our best to match it, depending on availability.

5\. Can I cancel my emergency booking if my situation changes?

Yes, you can cancel your emergency booking. However, since these services are fast and same-day, some charges may apply if the helper is already on the way. For best results, inform our support team as early as possible.

8\. How is emergency service different from regular part-time maid service?
