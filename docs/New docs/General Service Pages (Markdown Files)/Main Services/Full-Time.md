Key things to know for a smooth full-time maid hiring experience.

1.  Working Hours

Full-time maids usually work for 8 to 10 hours daily based on your selected plan. Any additional hours should be discussed beforehand.

2.  Weekly Offs

Your maid is entitled to one week off, ideally planned in advance. National or religious holidays can also be mutually discussed.

3.  No Multi-tasking:

It's important to understand that a full-time maid specialised in one area is not expected to handle multiple duties concurrently (e.g., a cook is not also a babysitter) unless mutually agreed upon during hiring.
