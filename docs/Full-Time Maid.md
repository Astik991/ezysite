**FAQs**

**Q: What is the difference between full-time maid and live-in maid services?** A full-time maid Bangalore works 8-10 hours daily and returns home, while live-in maids stay 24/7. Full-time service offers professional support without accommodation requirements.

**Q: Can full-day maid in Bangalore adjust to IT professional schedules?** Yes, our maids are trained to work with early morning starts (as early as 6 AM) and evening schedules (up to 8 PM) to support Bangalore's tech workforce.

**Q: Do full-time maids work on weekends?** Our full-day maids typically work 6 days a week with one weekly day off. Emergency weekend support is available on request.

**Q: Can the maid handle both cooking and cleaning in 8-10 hours?** No, one maid typically specialises in a specific task. If you hire a maid for cleaning, she focuses only on cleaning duties. If you hire a cook, she will handle cooking and may assist with light cleaning or top-up work if time allows. For both cooking and cleaning, we recommend hiring two separate helpers to ensure quality and efficiency.

**Q: Is full-time maid service cost-effective for small families?** Full-time service offers better value than multiple part-time helpers, especially for working couples in Bangalore's competitive rental market.

**Q: Do you provide maids familiar with North Indian cooking?** Yes, we match maids for full-time, based on cuisine preferences, including North Indian, South Indian, and continental cooking skills.

**Q: How do you ensure the safety of full-time maid services?** We ensure safety by verifying every maid’s Aadhaar ID and local address. Police verification is available on request for added security and peace of mind.

**Q: Can full-time maids manage modern apartment living in Bangalore?** Our full-day maids in Bangalore are trained in using modern appliances, following apartment rules, and managing day-to-day urban home needs.

**Q: Do full-time maids take weekly off?**

Yes, most full-time maids take one day off per week. The day can be fixed based on mutual agreement and household convenience.

**Q: How are maids trained before placement?**

We conduct skill assessment and soft skill orientation before assigning full-time maids. This includes hygiene, safety, and household discipline basics.

**Q: Are full-time maids available for single-person households?**

Absolutely. Full-time maids are also ideal for working professionals, senior citizens, or bachelors who need daily help with cleaning and cooking.

**Q: Do I need to provide food for the full-time maid?**

Providing meals is not mandatory. Most maids bring their own food, though offering water, tea, or snacks is a courteous gesture. However, offering water, tea, or snacks is a common gesture and helps build a positive working relationship. Many households do choose to provide meals.

**Q: How do I give feedback or report an issue with the maid?**

You can contact our customer support or use our feedback portal. We take complaints seriously and ensure professional behavior and performance.
