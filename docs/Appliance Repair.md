**H2:** **Why Wait for a Breakdown? Know These 5 Early Appliance Warning Signs**

At EzyHelpers, we recommend timely servicing to prevent costly breakdowns. Watch for these early signs to keep your appliances running smoothly.

1.  **Unusual noises or vibrations** Sounds like buzzing, clicking, or rattling usually indicate loose or damaged internal parts.
    
2.  **Higher electricity bills** Appliances that are running inefficiently tend to consume more power without obvious signs.
    
3.  **Longer operating times** If your washing machine, AC, or fridge takes longer to complete tasks, it likely needs attention.
    
4.  **Overheating or burning smell** This could indicate electrical faults or clogged vents, which may pose fire risks if not addressed.
    
5.  **Delayed response or unresponsive controls** Slow or unresponsive buttons and displays often signal internal component wear or malfunction.
