**Live-in maids** stay in your home and provide 24/7 support, making them ideal for families needing round-the-clock help with newborns, elderly care, or emergencies. They offer flexibility, emotional companionship, and adapt easily to your schedule.

**Full-time maids** work fixed hours and return to their own home after their shift. They are suited for regular household tasks like cleaning or cooking during the day and are more affordable, offering structured help with greater privacy. Choose based on your support needs and comfort level.

In summary, choose a live-in maid for 24/7 support or a full-time maid for fixed hours based on your needs and comfort. Your choice depends on how much support you need and how comfortable you are with having someone stay in your home.
